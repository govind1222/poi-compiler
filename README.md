## About
A GUI for keeping track of points of interest in 2D renderings of 3D video. A user can click on any point in the image and 
the application will automatically keep track of the X and Y coordinates of that point. After
the user has identified all points of interest in the images, the program will compile all
the coordinates of points of interest into an Excel file
